    <h1>X-ray reveals this 16th-century portrait got a cheekbone glow-up</h1>

        Young Derich Born’s cheekbones were not always sharp enough to peel
        apples. New research and conservation work on the 1533 portrait by Hans
        Holbein the Younger has revealed that the painter made repeated small
        changes, each time giving Born even more chiseled features.

      <p>
        The dazzling result bears an inscription on the parapet under Born’s
        arm, presumably composed by Holbein. Lifted from a near-identical
        tribute to Albrecht Dürer, the translated statement boasts: “If you
        added a voice, this would be Derich his very self. You would be in doubt
        whether the painter or his father made him.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The painting, newly conserved after work at the J. Paul Getty Museum in
        Los Angeles, California, was once owned by Charles I, and bought back by
        Charles II as he tried to reassemble the Royal Collection scattered
        under the politician Oliver Cromwell. It will now star in an exhibition
        at the Queen’s Gallery in Buckingham Palace, opening November 10, which
        traces the work in England of the German-born Holbein, and his rise to
        become the favorite artist of the Tudor court.

        Born was not royal but a German merchant in the Steelyard in London, the
        Thames-side headquarters of the Hanseatic League — a powerful group of
        traders, at least seven of whom commissioned portraits from Holbein,
        with two now surviving in the Royal Collection, according to the
        exhibition catalog. Born was just 23 when he commissioned his portrait,
        and was evidently as arrogant as his features. He was expelled from
        England in 1541 after getting into an unwise dispute with the powerful
        Duke of Suffolk, and according to the show’s curator, Kate Heard, was
        still grumbling about it a decade later.

        Nicola Christie, the head of painting conservation at the Royal
        Collection, told The Art Newspaper she was concerned about the condition
        of the painting when the Getty Museum requested a loan for its own
        2021-2022 Holbein exhibition, “Capturing Character in the Renaissance.”
        The wealthy institution promptly offered to bring her to California for
        months of work with the assistance of its laboratories and a squad of
        scientists, but because of delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the
        painting was shown before it underwent conservation. The results,
        including gentle cleaning revealing the subtlety of Holbein’s treatment
        of the textures of black satin and fur, will be seen for the first time
        in the London exhibition.

        The portrait was made on two planks of Baltic oak, with a seam running
        vertically through Born’s face. Christie discovered that, centuries ago,
        the splitting sections were separated and glued together slightly
        misaligned, leaving a visible ridge which was filled and overpainted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christie says it was impossible to contemplate separating the boards
        again. “I’m here to tell you that it is extremely well stuck together,
        they knew what they were doing in the 18th century,” she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she succeeded in removing filler, revealing its original surface,
        and has painted in some of the losses. “It was a long, long task working
        under a microscope, and quite terrifying, but one of the delights was
        finding original paint beneath these old layers,” she explained.
      </p>
      <p>
        The analysis, including X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and
        gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry, has identified the different
        layers and pigments Holbein used to build up the portrait, from the gray
        ground to the thin layers of paint for Born’s face and opulent outfit
        luxury clothing, using the most expensive dyes to achieve an intense
        shade of black, and finally the azurite background. The X-rays showed
        that Holbein made several adjustments to the face, shoulder and hat,
        giving Born more sculpted features.
      </p>
      <p>
        No preparatory drawing survives for the portrait, but the painting will
        be shown with 40 of Holbein’s other most beautiful drawings from the
        Royal Collection, including studies of Henry VIII, his children, the
        future monarchs Mary I and Edward VI, and several wives including Anne
        Boleyn and Jane Seymour, according to the press release.

        Born vanishes from history after trading a consignment of towels in
        Antwerp in 1549, but Heard has found no evidence that he died young.
        “It’s just a question of which records survive — he may have lived a
        long prosperous life, still grumbling about being kicked out of
        England,” she said.
